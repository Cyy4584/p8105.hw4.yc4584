# Introductory 
At beginning, I will briefly introduce myself including my life and academic background.

## Life
I was born in a small town in China, which is Harbin. Here is the picture taken in a winter day in Harbin.

As you could see, my hometown is a city of ice and snow. The average temperature in winter is around -20 degrees Celsius. Also, it is called "Ice city" because of its ice sculptures and winter activities.

Here is a picture of famous ice sculptures.
